# Co-Emplettes: Shared Grocery Shopping for Students

## Overview

Co-Emplettes is a unique mobile application designed to address the challenges faced by students around the Télécom Paris campus in accessing affordable groceries. The platform facilitates shared grocery shopping, allowing students to collaborate on bulk purchases from more economical supermarkets.

## Problem Statement

The Saclay plateau lacks affordable shops, leading students to travel to more budget-friendly supermarkets. Co-Emplettes aims to streamline this process by enabling students to delegate grocery shopping to their peers who have convenient access to these stores. The goal is to reduce the overall cost of living for students while fostering a sense of community.

## Features

- **Shared Shopping Trips:** Students can coordinate and collaborate on grocery shopping trips, either by car or bike.
- **Delivery System:** Students who shop for groceries are paid by others, sharing the cost and effort of obtaining affordable goods.
- **Payment System:** Users contribute a small fee for the delivery service, which compensates the student shopper.
- **Drive Selection Algorithm:** The app evaluates various criteria (travel time, price, availability) to recommend the most suitable supermarket for each shared trip.
- **Locker System:** Groceries are organized in lockers by the student shopper, allowing convenient pick-up by recipients based on their schedules.
- **Fresh Produce Option:** Specialized option for fresh produce allows users to customize their orders, with delivery persons picking up products in-store.
